      summary: AutoDeposit
      description: |-
        AutoDeposit is called by the bidder node to add a recurring deposit in the bidder registry. The bidder
        can specify the amount of ETH to be deposited in each window. The bidder can also specify the start window
        number for the deposit. If the start window number is not specified, the current block number is used to
        calculate the window number. If the block number is specified, the window number is calculated based on
        the block number. Once it is enabled, the node will automatically deposit the specified amount in each window
        as well as withdraw the deposit from the previous window.
