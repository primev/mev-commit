# Mev-commit AVS Implementation

## Overview

The `MevCommitAVS` contract(s) will be deployed on L1 to act as a tie-in to the eigenlayer core contracts, enabling validators to opt-in to the mev-commit protocol via restaking. It serves as the next iteration of our validator registry. Notion has a more detailed protocol design doc, whereas this doc is specific to the implementation. See the following files for current implementation:

* [IMevCommitAVS.sol](../interfaces/IMevCommitAVS.sol)
* [MevCommitAVS.sol](./MevCommitAVS.sol)
* [MevCommitAVSStorage.sol](./MevCommitAVSStorage.sol)

## Operator registration

Operators will not yet be assigned concrete tasks as a part of our AVS, however they are nonetheless able to register with our AVS to abide by the `IAVSDirectory.registerOperatorToAVS` and `IAVSDirectory.deregisterOperatorFromAVS` functions that any AVS must implement. Registration is simple for Operators and only requires providing a valid signature. To deregister, Operators must first `requestOperatorDeregistration`, wait a configurable amount of blocks, then call `deregisterOperator`. No staking is required of Operators.

Operators mainly serve the purpose of (optionally) being able to register validators on their behalf, if the relevant validator is delegated to them. Future iterations of our AVS can assign Operators required oracle tasks, as further discussed in the _Future Upgrades_ section.

## Validator Opt-in

Recall that a native-restaking enabled validator opting-in to mev-commit requires two high level steps:

1. The validator must delegate (via eigenlayer core) their native stake to an Operator who's registered with the mev-commit AVS.
2. The validator must separately be *registered* with the mev-commit AVS, confirming their attestation to follow the rules of the protocol.

Multiple validator public keys can be registered at once, alongside their associated eigenpod owner `podOwner` address. Note each eigenpod owner account may represent one or many restaked validators:

```solidity
function registerValidatorsByPodOwner(bytes[] calldata valPubKeys, address podOwner);
```

This function verifies and updates state such that directly after the call, `isValidatorOptedIn(valPubKey)` will return true for each `valPubKey`.

Note two entities are able to register validator pub keys in this way:

1. The eigenpod owner account itself.
2. The (delegated and fully registered) Operator account.

If an Operator is registering pubkeys on behalf of validators, it's expected that the Operator manages those validators itself, or represents the validators to an extent that the Operator can realistically attest to the validator following the rules of mev-commit (staking-as-a-service providers for example). This trustful relationship between validators and their delegated Operator piggybacks off already agreed upon trust assumptions with eigenlayer delegation.

Validator deregistration requires calling `requestValidatorsDeregistration`, waiting a configurable amount of blocks, then calling `deregisterValidators`. These functions are similarly callable by the eigenpod owner OR delegated operator. A delegated operator calling either `requestValidatorsDeregistration` or `deregisterValidators` does not require that operator to be registered with the MevCommitAVS (this is allowed due to aforementioned trust assumptions between validators and their delegated Operator).

### What defines a validator staying "opted-in"

A validator staying opted-in following registration is explicitly defined by the following criteria:

1. The validator's registration entry must still exists with the MevCommitAVS (ie. validator has not been deregistered).
2. The validator must not be frozen.
3. The validator must not have requested deregistration with the MevCommitAVS.
4. The validator must be `VALIDATOR_STATUS.ACTIVE` with respect to its eigenpod.
5. The validator's delegated operator must be registered with the MevCommitAVS.
6. The validator's delegated operator must not have requested deregistration with the MevCommitAVS.

Directly following a successful call to `registerValidatorsByPodOwner`, all of these criteria will be true as enforced by the function. However, anyone of these criteria becoming false will result in the validator no longer being "opted-in" from the mev-commit protocol's perspective.

For example if an opted-in validator's delegated operator requests deregistration with the MevCommitAVS, the eigenpod owner representing this validator needs to [redelegate to a new operator](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/restaker-delegation/redelegation-process) who's registered with the MevCommitAVS, to reclaim opted-in status.

## LST Restaker Registration

LST restakers are also able to register with our avs by:

1. Depositing into at least one strategy with eigenlayer core.
2. Delegating to an Operator who's registered with the mev-commit AVS.
3. Calling `registerLSTRestaker` with one or more chosen validator pubkey(s).

```solidity 
function registerLSTRestaker(bytes[] calldata chosenValidators) external onlyNonRegisteredLstRestaker() onlySenderWithRegisteredOperator()
```

LST restakers will receive points/rewards commensurate with their chosen validator(s) being opted-in over time. Nothing enforces that validators chosen by LST restakers must be "opted-in" as described above. That is, responsibility is left up to the LST restaker as to choosing validators that are, and will stay, opted-in. When an LST restaker chooses multiple validators, attribution is split evenly between the validators.

Validator opt-in state can be queried with `isValidatorOptedIn()`. This query offers concrete criteria that must be true for an LST restaker to accrue points/rewards over time from a chosen validator. 

Since validators are chosen in sets, an LST restaker can only choose a new set of validators by deregistering, and registering again with the new set. This simplifies contract implementation and enforces an LST restaker is responsible for the actions of its chosen validator(s).

Points/rewards for LST restakers would be computed off-chain, with heavy use of indexed events. As there is not an efficient on-chain mapping from each validator to the set of LST restakers who've chosen that validator. When a rewards/points system is introduced, it may consider the following information (and possibly more):

* Opt-in state over time of the LST restaker's chosen validator(s), as defined above.
* The block height when the LST restaker registered with the AVS, requested deregistration, and/or deregistered.
* The amount and denomination of LST that the restaker delegated to a mev-commit registered Operator over time. Changes in LST delegation via the eigenlayer core contracts will affect point/reward accrual.
* Operator deregistration events, if for example an LST restaker's delegated Operator is deregistered with the mev-commit AVS.
* Correctly proposed blocks by the LST restaker's chosen validator(s).

Deregistration requires the restaker calling `requestLSTRestakerDeregistration`, waiting a configurable amount of blocks, then calling `deregisterLSTRestaker`.

## Freezing

A permissioned oracle account is able to `freeze` any registered validator for acting maliciously against agreements to the mev-commit protocol:

```solidity
function freeze(bytes calldata valPubKey) external onlyFreezeOracle();
```

While frozen, a validator will not accrue points or rewards. A validator cannot deregister from the AVS while frozen.

To exit the frozen state, a configurable unfreeze period must first pass. Then any account can call `unfreeze`:

```solidity
function unfreeze(bytes[] calldata valPubKey) payable external;
```

where a minimum of `unfreezeFee` must be included in the transaction. Upon being unfrozen, the validator transitions to the `REQUESTED_DEREGISTRATION` state (ie. is no longer "opted-in"), and can eventually deregister from the AVS.

The points/rewards for LST restakers will consider freeze related events. However, LST restakers are allowed to deregister from the AVS even if any of their chosen validator(s) are frozen.

Freezing is the mechanism that punishes a validator prior to eigenlayer core contracts having slashing. For now freezing corresponds to a public, reputational slash for the validator (and relevant LST restakers), and a lack of potential points accrual.

## Note Frozen Validators

Frozen validators (those who haven't yet paid the unfreeze fee) are **able, but not allowed** to register with the vanilla registry or middleware registry. In these scenarios, the frozen validator will be immediately slashed by the oracle via the relevant contract, directly after registration. The off-chain oracle logic **must** monitor registrations from the vanilla registry and middleware registry, along with freeze status from the MevCommitAVS. The oracle will slash relevant frozen validator(s) if any of them attempt to maliciously register outside the MevCommitAVS, without paying the unfreeze fee.

## Configuration of Deregistration Periods

`operatorDeregPeriodBlocks`, `validatorDeregPeriodBlocks`, and `lstRestakerDeregPeriodBlocks` must be set such that a mev-commit bidder knows all _currently opted-in_ block proposers from the current epoch, and next epoch, must deliver commitments, or are guaranteed freezable.

For similar reasoning to the `slashPeriodSeconds` configuration in the [middleware README](../middleware/README.md#configuration-of-slashperiodseconds), the minimum value for these deregistration periods is:

`6 L1 epochs` + `oracleProcessingPeriod`

A recommended value to assume for `oracleProcessingPeriod` is 60 minutes, although longer is always beneficial as a buffer for oracle freeze transaction inclusion.

## Design Intentions

When looking through this design doc one may ask, _why do validators and LST restakers have to delegate to an Operator through the eigenlayer core contracts, AND separately register with the AVS contract?_

The answer is that **stakers** are the L1 entities that enable credible commitments through our AVS, not Operators. It would be challenging to slash/freeze entirely through Operators, in that an Operator can potentially represent thousands of validators and LST restakers from different organizations, home-staking setups, etc.

Further, we need some sort of explicit mechanism for **stakers** (not Operators) to attest to following the rules of mev-commit, at the risk of being slashed. Eigenlayer's current design does not offer this on a per-AVS basis.

## Future Upgrades 

* Operators could be given the task of replacing the oracle service that currently freezes (or will eventually slash) validators. This could rely on honest Operator majority, or a multi-tier slashing system where EIGEN holders are able to slash Operators, while the Operator set is able to slash validators.
* Operators could further be required to run a validator node for the existing mev-commit chain, an evm sidechain which manages preconf settlement. Thus decentralizing preconf settlement.

## Open Questions

* Will upcoming Eigenlayer upgrades allow for slashing stakers (validators or LST restakers) directly? Or will Operators be the only slashable entities? If the latter is true, our AVS design will need to drastically change, and may necessitate more complexity.
