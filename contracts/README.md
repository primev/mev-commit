# Contracts

## Overview

This repository contains Solidity contracts and tests for handling pre-confirmation commitments and bids. The system uses two separate registries to manage bidders and providers, where both parties must stake ETH to participate. Commitments are verified and stored in a contract.

### PreConfCommitmentStore

This is the core contract that handles pre-confirmation commitments. It uses EIP-712 for typed data hashing and signing. Commitments are stored in a mapping, accessible via their hash.

#### Functions

- `getBidHash`: Generates a hash of the bid based on the transaction hash, bid amount, and block number.
- `getPreConfHash`: Generates a hash of the pre-confirmation commitment.
- `recoverAddress`: Recovers the signer's address from a message digest and a signature.
- `verifyBid`: Verifies a bid's validity by checking the signer's stake and the bid amount.
- `storeCommitment`: Stores a valid commitment in the contract.
-

### IBidderRegistry

This is an interface that must be implemented by the bidder registry contract. It contains methods for registering, staking, and retrieving funds.

#### Functions

- `prepay`: Registers a bidder and prepays ETH.
- `getAllowance`: Checks the prepayed amount for a given bidder.
- `depositFunds`: Deposits additional funds into the contract.
- `retrieveFunds`: Retrieves a specific amount of funds for a bidder and sends them to a provider.

### IProviderRegistry

This is an interface that must be implemented by the provider registry contract. It contains methods for registering, depositing funds, slashing, and rewarding.

#### Functions

- `registerAndStake`: Registers a provider and stakes ETH.
- `checkStake`: Checks the staked amount for a given provider.
- `depositFunds`: Deposits additional funds into the contract.
- `slash`: Slashes a specific amount of staked ETH from a provider and sends it to a bidder.
- `reward`: Rewards a specific amount of ETH to a provider.

Note: In both IProviderRegistry and IBidderRegistry - some functions are restrictied to be called exclusively by the preconfimration contract.

### Whitelist

To enable bridging to native ether, bridging contracts need be able to mint/burn native ether. The `Whitelist` is responsible for managing a whitelist of addresses that can mint/burn native ether. An admin account must be specified on deployment, who is the only address that can mutate the whitelist.

#### Functions

- `addToWhitelist`: allows only the admin to add an address to the whitelist.
- `removeFromWhitelist`: allows only the admin to remove an address from the whitelist.
- `isWhitelisted`: returns boolean indicating if an address is whitelisted.
- `mint`: allows whitelisted addresses to mint specific amount of native ether to any account.
- `burn`: allows whitelisted addresses to burn specific amount of native ether from any account.

## Tests

The tests in this repository perform the following:

- Deployment of the `ProviderRegistry`, `BidderRegistry`, and `Whitelist` contracts.
- Registration and staking of bidders and providers.
- Verification of bid hashes and pre-confirmation commitment hashes.
- Recovery of signer addresses.
- Storage of valid commitments.
- Tests basic whitelisting functionality.

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

#### Deploy Scripts using hardhat

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

#### Deploy Scripts using forge

- Install foundryup

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

- Running foundryup by itself will install the latest (nightly) precompiled binaries: forge, cast, anvil and chisel
```
foundryup
```

- Setup ENV Vars

```
export RPC_URL="http://localhost:8545/"
export PRIVATE_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
export CHAIN_ID=17864
```

- Run the deploy script for core contracts

```
forge script scripts/DeployScripts.s.sol:DeployScript --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --chain-id $CHAIN_ID -vvvv --use 0.8.23
```

- Run deploy script for whitelist contract, HYP_ERC20_ADDR denotes the HypERC20.sol contract address to give native mint/burn privileges.

```
HYP_ERC20_ADDR=0xBe3dEF3973584FdcC1326634aF188f0d9772D57D forge script scripts/DeployScripts.s.sol:DeployWhitelist --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --chain-id $CHAIN_ID -vvvv --use 0.8.23
```

#### Note on CREATE2

Foundry scripts in this repo use the CREATE2 opcode to deploy for every contract. Meaning deployment on any chain will yield the same contract addresses, given a constant deployer account, contract bytecode, and salt.

This means the solidity version used for contract compilation affects the addresses those contracts will be deployed to. Solidity 0.8.23 is the canonical version to use.

It's recommended to use `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` as the deployer account so that contract addresses will match external facing documentation. In production this address will have proper key management, for now here's the private key: `ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`.

The CREATE2 proxy needs to be deployed prior to these contracts. See [this repo](https://github.com/primevprotocol/deterministic-deployment-proxy), or this [make command](https://github.com/primevprotocol/go-ethereum/blob/d29cfe94205e852cc57a8184585ccc895d32a517/geth-poa/Makefile#L48) to deploy. Anvil automatically deploys this proxy to the expected address.

Using the above private key and compiling with solidity 0.8.23, expected contract addresses are:

```bash
UserRegistry deployed to: 0xe38B5a8C41f307646F395030992Aa008978E2699
ProviderRegistry deployed to: 0x7fA45D14358B698Bd85a0a2B03720A6Fe4b566d7
PreConfCommitmentStore deployed to: 0x8B0F623dCD54cA50CD154B3dDCbB8436E876b019
Oracle deployed to: 0x628F330Ae673df7D73d943f9590A4d643e4197f6
Whitelist deployed to: 0x5D1415C0973034d162F5FEcF19B50dA057057e29

## Local Contract Deployment with Anvil

### Prerequisites
Ensure Foundry is installed with Anvil, Cast, and Forge.

### Steps

1. **Start Anvil**:
    Open a terminal and run Anvil to initiate a local Ethereum network simulation:

    ```bash
    anvil
    ```

    Anvil will start and display a list of available accounts and their corresponding private keys, pre-funded with Ethereum for testing purposes.

2. **Note the Private Keys**:
    Anvil provides a set of accounts with their private keys. Example output:

    ```
    Available Accounts
    ==================

    (0) "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266" (10000 ETH)
    (1) "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8" (10000 ETH)
    ... (more accounts) ...

    Private Keys
    ==================

    (0) 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
    (1) 0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d
    ... (more keys) ...
    ```

3. **Deploy Your Contract**:
    Use one of the provided private keys to deploy your contract using Forge. Example command:

    ```bash
    forge create PreConfCommitmentStore --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 --constructor-args 0xD7a4B4cbA2DAb2dc3E2FCa91ea903Bf49842FD87 0xD7a4B4cbA2DAb2dc3E2FCa91ea903Bf49842FD87 0xD7a4B4cbA2DAb2dc3E2FCa91ea903Bf49842FD87
    ```

    After executing the command, you should see an output similar to the following:

    ```
    eth_getBlockByNumber
    eth_feeHistory
    eth_sendRawTransaction

        Transaction: 0x0229f1adf045bfcc554f0ecff57d5a6cff05aecf222479a1a568ac840386dfff
        Contract created: 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3
        Gas used: 2733597
    ```
