**# Devnet Setup Script**

A helper script to quickly bootstrap a new PoA devnet by creating signer accounts and genesis files.

**## Quick Start**

```bash
# Run the script
./setup-devnet.sh
```
```
# Follow the prompts:
# 1. Enter password (or press Enter to auto-generate)
# 2. Paste the generated address (0x...)
# 3. Enter Chain ID (e.g., 5054)

This script simplifies the manual process of creating accounts and genesis files when setting up new test networks.
