# This file lists artifacts of this project build that shouldn't be checked in.
# For other files created by specific development environment, use alternative
# ways to exclude those files from git. For example, set up .git/info/exclude
# or use a global .gitignore. A .gitingore file for a particular branch is
# only allowed if it excludes files that are specific to that branch and
# should not be excluded globally.
